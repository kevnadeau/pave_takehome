# Kevin Nadeau

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses [Highcharts](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-react) for graphs, [react-select](https://react-select.com/home) for the selector components, and [papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) to decode CSVs

# How it works

This contains selectors which control the grouping and axes for a chart. The chart does not render if there are no values selected.

The raw data is also combined into a table on the page. No additional features were implemented on the table.
